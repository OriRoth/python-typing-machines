# Python Type Hints are Turing Complete

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7004898.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7004898)

We present a reduction from Turing machines to Python type hints. The Turing machine accepts its input if and only if
the Python program is correctly typed.

## How did it happen?

[Python enhancement proposal (PEP) 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/)
added optional type hints to the Python programming language. One of the features of the proposed type system is
[nominal subtyping with variance](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#covariance-and-contravariance). Radu Grigore showed
that [this particular form of subtyping is Turing complete](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05274)
by describing a reduction from Turing machines to class tables. This project applies Radu's construction with Python
type hints.

## How can I try it?

Here is one possible script (also found in `typing_machines/app.py`):

```python
from typing_machines.app import *  # import application
with open("example.py", "w") as python_file:  # write palindromes machine and input "abbabba"
    python_file.write(encode(Algorithm.Grigore, palindromes, "abbabba"))
sleep(1)  # wait for write operation
with Popen(["mypy", "example.py"]) as p:  # run mypy
    retcode = p.wait(timeout=10)
assert retcode == 0  # compiles successfully, "abbabba" is a palindrome
with open("example.py", "w") as python_file:  # write palindromes machine and input "abbbaba"
    python_file.write(encode(Algorithm.Grigore, palindromes, "abbbaba"))
sleep(1)  # wait for write operation
with Popen(["mypy", "example.py"]) as p:  # run mypy
    retcode = p.wait(timeout=10)
assert retcode != 0  # does not compile, "abbbaba" is not a palindrome
```

The `palindromes` Turing machine is defined in `typing_machines/examples/machines.py`. You can add new machines in this
file.

## Wait, so `mypy` can get into an infinite loop?

Kind of. As with many other compilers, the subtyping algorithm implemented in `mypy` is recursive, so, recursion +
infinite loop = *stack overflow*. In fact, even this simple program makes `mypy` throw a segmentation fault:

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic
T = TypeVar("T", contravariant=True)
class N(Generic[T]): ...
class C(N[N["C"]]): ...
_: N[C] = C()
```

This is *not* a `mypy` bug. The problem of verifying Python type hints is undecidable, so `mypy` getting stuck for
certain programs is unavoidable.

## What's new?

We introduce an alternative construction that is supposed to compile much faster for large inputs. You can try the new
construction by using `Algorithm.Roth` instead of
`Algorithm.Grigore` in the script above.

## Is my type checker in danger?

We simulate Turing machines and infinite loops at the type level using contravariant type parameters. Thus, your type
checker can get into an infinite loop using our methods only if it supports variance as described in PEP 484.

| Type Checker      | Discipline | Supports Variance?       |
|-------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Mypy 0.991        | static     | <center>&#9679;</center> |
| Pyre 0.9.17       | static     | <center>&#9679;</center> |
| Pyright 1.1.279   | static     | <center>&#9680;</center> |
| Pytype 2022.11.10 | static     | <center>&#9675;</center> |
| Pyanalyze 0.8.0   | static     | <center>&#9675;</center> |
| Pydantic 1.10.2   | dynamic    | <center>&#9675;</center> |
| Pytypes 1.0b10    | dynamic    | <center>&#9675;</center> |
| Typeguard 2.13.3  | dynamic    | <center>&#9675;</center> |
| Typical 2.8.0     | dynamic    | <center>&#9675;</center> |

The programs used to obtain these results are found in `motivation/static` and
`motivation/dynamic`.

Note that Pyright is *unsound*, which means that it reports errors for
correctly-typed programs, so its variance support is only partial.
For example, the code in `motivation/static/pyright_unsound.py` is correctly
typed, Mypy and Pyre report no error when checking the file, but Pyright does
report an error.
